# FunctionExplorer
This program is designed to compute and visualize the values and derivatives of single-variable functions using numerical methods. It caters to functions defined both analytically (via explicit formulas) and tabularly (from values stored in a data file). The implementation adheres to the outlined recommendations and follows a structured scheme.
